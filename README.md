# Hangman_Game

This code is a simple implementation of the Hangman game in Python. Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The code begins by importing the necessary modules, `random` and `time`, which are used for generating random words and introducing delays in the game.

2. The user is prompted to enter their name, and a welcome message is displayed.

3. The `main()` function is defined. It initializes and sets the initial values for various game-related variables such as `count` (number of incorrect guesses), `display` (current state of the word with correctly guessed letters), `word` (the word to be guessed), `already_guessed` (list of already guessed letters), `length` (length of the word), and `play_game` (option to play again or exit the game).

4. The `play_loop()` function is defined. It asks the user if they want to play again, validates the input, and either starts a new game by calling `main()` or exits the program.

5. The `hangman()` function is defined. It contains the main logic of the game. It initializes the `limit` variable to 5 (the maximum number of incorrect guesses allowed). Then, the user is prompted to enter a guess for the hangman word. The input is validated to ensure it is a single letter.

6. If the guess is a valid letter and it is present in the word, the code updates the `already_guessed` list, replaces the corresponding underscore in the `display` string with the guessed letter, and prints the updated `display`.

7. If the guess is already in the `already_guessed` list, it informs the user to try another letter.

8. If the guess is not valid or incorrect, the `count` variable is incremented, and the code checks the value of `count` to determine which stage of the hangman to display. The hangman stages are printed with ASCII art.

9. If the `count` reaches the limit of incorrect guesses (5), the user is informed that they have lost the game. The correct word is displayed along with the letters that were already guessed. Then, the `play_loop()` function is called to ask if the user wants to play again or exit.

10. If the entire word has been guessed correctly, the user is informed that they have won the game, and the `play_loop()` function is called.

11. If the game is not over yet, the `hangman()` function calls itself recursively to continue the game.

12. Finally, the `main()` function is called to start the game, followed by the initial call to the `hangman()` function.

This code allows the user to play the Hangman game, guess letters to uncover the word, and provides feedback on the correctness of the guesses.
